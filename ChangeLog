0ab57c9 Remove HFST dependency - fixes #26; Move tests to folder
687b3c1 The --with-extract arg now sets the default - the other option is still tried if default fails; Oddly enough, this fixes issue #26 for no good reason - it's happily extracting to memory now, when it wasn't before.

bf79d25 Add returns
8573403 Merge branch 'big_endian_compatibility_suggestion' In hopes that this approach to fixing build problems on the problematic architectures will get tested for Debian builds. This is experimental, but at least shouldn't break anything - feel free to revert if unhelpful.
b756b2e Killed an error. Don't know whether it was the correct solution - please review.
3ca7756 max version for tinyxml
662f79c (origin/big_endian_compatibility_suggestion) Forgot to actually assign header length to a variable when reading raw bytes
abed65f A suggestion for big-endian compatibility
43f5dc6 (tag: v0.4.2) Release 0.4.2.
e9cc1da Prevent segfaults from no-errormodel.sh test This also makes the test succeed rather than XLFAIL, so removed it from XFAIL_TESTS (why not?)
6d359c0 Remove unused $(HFST_FLAGS) variable that may be leading to some test failures

90d7fcb Fix typo that broke UNKNOWN handling the the error source
0ff3b88 Fix bug in novel symbol tokenization
791ca3e Bounds check table accesses Now that new symbols from input can be added to the lexicon's alphabet, it's possible that during checking we try to access beyond the lexicon's table boundaries, so that needs to be prevented.
0865615 CentOS 6 fixes: Move AC_INIT up to prevent _m4_divert_diversion error; Use older ax_check_compile_flag.m4
833e6f6 autoconf-archive doesn't exist on RPM platforms, so bundle ax_check_compile_flag.m4
e59a06e Determine and use highest supported C++ standard
f8d3893 Reinstate legacy function Transducer::lookup() due to Voikko's use of it
b645b28 Unknown and identity arcs can now appear both in the lexicon and error model This is a rather large overhaul of everything having to do with symbols, and causes an approximately 8% slowdown at this time. Some more efforts will be made to bring that down..
28cd37b Make weight checking methods const
d76526a Correct nbest handling for cached results too + remove extranous comparison class

14c72ca Arguably clearer scheme for combining limiting options
0c5eeec Reinstate legacy spelling, slightly adding to but not altering interface
4d1fa2b Add option --beam=W for restricting the search to a margin above the optimum. Any combination of n-best, weight limit and beam is possible, all restrict each other.
29180f3 Use vector instead of deque now that breadth search isn't used for anything
ea15127 Be a bit more systematic about search-limiting behaviour, also fail earlier, this gives a small speed improvement
a9d9e55 Make argument parsing further agree with documentation, reinstating -X
e2b9b7e nbest wasn't producing any runtime benefit due to incorrect comparison

f19070d A tiny performance improvement (about 5%, this is not what was discussed on irc, but every little helps)
a674152 Fix missing newline in verbose message
ba22ebb This is how I got the analysing speller to work
f884489 Simple example of analysis spelling logic
4019232 can analyse if speller or sugger
f621a37 Fix bug #239 When correcting, keep track of mutator's output / lexicon's input; when analysing, keep track of lexicon's output
bfd40d9 Fix bug #238 Now that alphabets are translated even if the error source contains symbols not found in the lexicon, the lexicon needs to be prepared to be asked whether there are transitions with NO_SYMBOL
f7b6dcc documentation front page
0a17be0 Dist changes, 0.3.0 API stable though pending other fixes for .1
03d40cc Some beginnings for a documented stable API.

f702e28 Better test case for analyser
c96a2e8 Add tests for analysing speller and missing errmodels
104a24d Analysis interface and implementation for two-tape language models. The suggestion engine still erroneously gives the analysis side of suggestion LM though.
75fc585 Now printing and reading to/from console works in hfst-ospell is it is compiled with -DWINDOWS.
94031ca Added a rule for man page creation in Makefile.am.
e293f96 Added a test for an empty zhfst file. It should fail, but presently hfst-ospell behaves as if all is ok, just that it isn't able to correct anything.
add8ddd Corrected return value to what it should be for a SKIP result, which I assume was intended.
09ea12d Added files to the distro.
de621bd Added test to check whether error models with extra chars are correctly handled. The test passes with revision 3793 of ospell.cc, and fails with revision 3729.
4860369 Silently ignore non-lexicon symbols in the error source, translating them to NO_SYMBOL on the output side.
9e8ae05 revert
8e74395 What happens if I do this?
41bb8cf Moving implementations?
9629091 Install men

832f9d0 Bumped version for tinyxml2 check to get lengthful Parse by Børre Gaup
201acd8 unarchive to mem and tinyxml2 xml length fixes from Harri Pitkänen
220e6cb Reverted the patch by Børre to clean the xml off of random byte noise after the end of the xml document. The issue was caused by zip compression incompatibilities between different plattforms, and the solution (for now) is to just skip compression altogether, using 'zip -Z store' instead when building the zhfst files. This creates a zip file readable everywhere (but without compression).
c57f0bd Test for trailing spaces in xml structure
ad60602 Patch by Børre Gaup to clean corrupted xml data returned from Libarchive when reading xml data from a zhfst file stored in RAM:
b0ba291 Whitespace changes to make the file easier to my eyes, comments. Added tests for empty locale and empty title elements.
42da63d Data and shell scripts to test empty titles and empty locale.
6b5145f Check for empty locale node.
0838caa Clean and ignore index.xml.
26e6b99 One more test for empty data.
2b1089f Added newline before error cause.
a440da7 Empty descriptions will throw (there might be others left)
58047b3 index.xml with empty descriptions
2f93bcc Test.strings shall not be deleted when cleaning
c4adeb0 Added check for the availability of pkg-config - without it configuration will fail in subtle but bad ways.
cd24885 Document for next release candidate
3365813 Missing model attribute parsing for errm
5ca88f6 Use Elements instead of Nodes and other such fixes

f25c609 Allow selection of xml backend
4be4b96 Switch <3 into >3 because it looks nicer.
5d80f3f strndup() fixed by Tommi.
e11a913 Pending proper understanding of why strndup is getting defined several times over, let's always use hfst_strndup() instead.
248d05d Add include guard to custom strndup so it doesn't get compiled more than once
af41cbf Move our custom strndup to ospell.h so it will be seen by all compilation units that need it
bd813b0 Renamed the hfstospell package and variables to what they used to be, in case that can help solve a build issue with libvoikko+hfst.
83b1a09 Wrap and load
f03ef00 versioninfo 3:1:1
d70a9e6 Preparing for 0.2.3 release.
c8ba084 Changed version number to 0.2.3, and renamed the package and tool name to 'hfst-ospell', since that is what the command-line tool is actually called, and it is consistent with the rest of the hfst tool names.
3d40399 Should fix #176 Flag state from the stack back was getting clobbered in some situations. Now we restore flag state after modifying it for new nodes.
ac10ddd Fix dist stuff, wrap.
3fa2b5d Use pkg-config instead of autoconf to check libarchive
7e422b7 Prepare files for 0.2.2
89a4a99 Fix few leaks
44b313c Fixes to [#165] by Harri Pitkänen
3ad822b Made some changes to depth-first searching to prevent just-added nodes getting removed. This appears fo fix a very long-standing and serious bug dating from r2763.
36fa55c When data is in memory, allocate & copy it in ospell rather than expect caller to keep track of it (which it usually doesn't)
8196d8a Add access to metadata
1da34c4 When initialised from memory, don't assume responsibility for freeing it
01a43fd Somewhat experimental (no checking) way of saving memory by ignoring alignment issues (4-5 x memory savings)

2ee0efc Add stuff for survey article
a439eaf Revert to breadth-first searching pending bugfix
8166a16 Search depth-first by preference for hope

b1b6b24 Enforce an n-best limit for continuing the search, just for breadth-first for now
78f2345 Don’t just break on empty lines
ab3f591 Switch order of errmodels and acceptors in legacy read
5baaaed set spelling caps on legacy read
7c60d3e Test fallback
a1b1e35 The VPATH approach to the test shell scripts was wrong. Now everything is working as it should.
fcef585 Enabling VPATH building for 'make check'.
f8d7a54 Whitespace change only in configure.ac. More generated files to ignore.
b6f6482 Added some whitespace to ease readability. Replaced pattern rules with suffix rules to make automake happy.

69ff631 Added raw memory constructors and table readers for slurping in transducers from char *
4772d28 Missing files lol
77c23cf ...and in that case the final identity states also are greater by one.
58e9512 When avoiding initial edits, there needs to be an extra inital state before we do any edits. So add the value of options.no_initial to the state range loop.
433e917 Commented out hfst-ospell-cicling from Makefile.
73f8871 Comment out missing cicling target
b6a3317 "else if" instead of incorrect "if" in option handling

49b4394 redundancy elimination was being performed one state too late (too little)
bb93e12 Add option to disable redundancy elimination
731db86 Initial support for redundancy elimination (refuse to do insertion after deletion or deletion after insertion)
83f85ce Bugfix: identity transitions were being forgotten in the last edit state
9ca92d4 Enforce @_UNKNOWN_SYMBOL_@ instead of @?@, which users didn't know about
2b001e6 Fixed one remaining UTF-8 stderr printing bug.
aee7a2a Fixed bug with the newline character not being stripped from excluded symbols
92ab53a Lines that start with ## are comments
fd5f560 Updated help message & added exclusion of symbols by prepending a ~
45442ab Wrap stderr with a utf-8 codec so we can print non-ascii symbols when verbose
5c27eca Write alphabet with weights when verbose
f9b426f Order of preference of alphabet definition is now configfile - commandline - transducer. If configfile gives a weight after a tab for symbols, they are used additively for all edits involving those symbols.
6629f88 Some clarifying comments
33e3c95 Rescue identities from being considered substitutions
4ce7bb0 utf-8 -decode the user-specified transitions from a conf file (so easy to forget one of these...)
42ec180 use same includedir in pc as makefile
40afbca don't declare strndup in public headers
b5a6c7a make ol exceptions in hfst_ol namespace, provide stdexception style what()
3a58fbb Add verbose, quiet
c821e19 * parse all of the metadata if possible * use c++ ``struct''s for metadata
3f5bb8b * Use temporary filenames by tmpsnam * Do not delete Transducers in data structures since it will segfault all   enchant-based applications in dtor

a2b4ea5 Preliminary zhfst support
d7bf3e8 Example from: http://norvig.com/spell-correct.html and similar tests
a2b9d15 The test for final weighted transitions involves target_index == 1 instead of weight == INFINITE_WEIGHT
3cb5d8a Fixed bug involving bytewise casting of longs to floats (I misunderstood what static_cast really does I guess).
7ff6a13 fread returns element count, not byte count
9c01f47 duplicate definitions
a433823 fix msvc problems
4f2c186 check fread return value as advised by gcc

915ef1d Some more const sprinkling
59040cc Misc. nonfunctional cleanup
5852517 Hack to make the test script handle unicode
915a6e2 Added character swaps to edit distance script. You have to enable them with the -s flag - they generate A(A-1)*D new states and twice that many transitions, where A is the size of the alphabet and D is the edit distance. Pretty expensive. Is there a better way?
f77baa8 Improvements to editdist.py - see test/editdist.py --help
fa61c7d Put 1.0 weights on the test generator script
2bea19e Minor enhancement to test script
fb6b65f Added helpful runtime error for alphabet translation problems, updated demo utility to make use of it

7344a8e Incorporated queue in speller proper
dbc3bae Fixed behaviour, added weightedness scaffolding
e4851c1 Corrected typo.
9df6f72 Initial commit of hfst-ospell. Basic functionality including OTHER symbol (@?@) and runtime alphabet translation is present; weighted transducers (probably to be the only option) and flag diacritic states for the mutator and lexicon forthcoming.
